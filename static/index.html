      If you're reading this, it means that one or more of the example
      servers are running.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following is a list of servers you can run to demonstrate specific
      features of express middleware. They're listed more or less in order of
      complexity, so if you feel like a beginner, favor the examples towards the
      beginning of the list. If you're an old pro, find the server you're
      interested in and go for it! If something doesn't make sense in a later
      example, scan the previous examples to see if there are "how to's."
    </p>

    <p>
      Officially, you're supposed to look at the nodify-express documentation
      to figure out how to start the server, but if that line has already scrolled
      off the top of the window, here's the cheat. To start any particular server,
      issue a command like this:
    </p>
    
    <blockquote><pre>node 001_static.js</pre></blockquote>
  
    <p>
      This command, for example, starts the first example server. Some
      servers take parameters, like this one:
    </p>
  
    <blockquote><pre>node 005_config.js --config 005_config.json</pre></blockquote>
  
    <p>
      Check the list of servers here for required options. If none are
      listed, you should be able to get away with the first form.
