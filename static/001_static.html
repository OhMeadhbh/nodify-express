    <h1>Sample Express Application 001 : Static Files</h1>

    <p>
      Welcome to the resource page for example application 001. You are currently
      viewing a HTML page served up using the
      <a href="http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/middleware-static.html">static middleware</a>
      from <a href="http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/">connect.js</a>. (Express.js is layered
      on top of a previous package called "connect.js")
    </p>
    
    <h2>Looking at the Logs</h2>
    
    <p>
      Now that you've requested this page, you may want to visit the log file for the 001_static.js
      application. You should see a line that looks like this:
      
    </p>

    <blockquote><pre>192.168.56.1 - - [Wed, 15 Feb 2012 00:41:52 GMT] "GET /001_static.html HTTP/1.1" 200 833 "http://helium.l.nodify.us:10100/" "blah... blah... blah..."</pre></blockquote>
    
    <p>
      If you click on a <a href="./foo.html">link to a resource that doesn't exist</a>, you should see something like this in the log:
    </p>
    
    <blockquote><pre>192.168.56.1 - - [Wed, 15 Feb 2012 00:44:39 GMT] "GET /foo.html HTTP/1.1" <strong>404</strong> - "-" "blah... blah... blah..."</pre></blockquote>
    
    <p>
      The main difference here is the 404 return code. This is just to show you that node + express can be setup to behave very similarly to apache.
      Visit the <a href="http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/middleware-logger.html">logger middleware page</a> for more info.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Favicons</h2>
    
    <p>
      Another topic covered in this example is the <a href="http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/middleware-favicon.html">favicon middleware</a>.
      <a href="/favicon.ico">Click here</a> to see the favicon this app is serving up.
    </p>

    <h2>Directory Listing</h2>
    
    <p>
      Express can be configured to provide directory listings if you like. Look what happens when you point your browser at the <a href="/css">/css</a>
      directory (that doesn't have an index.html file in it.)
