    <h1>Sample Express Application 002 : HTTPS Server</h1>

    <p>
      If you're reading this, it means you were able to start the http and/or https server(s).
      I've been running these examples on the <a href="http://www.nodify.us/appliance/">Nodify.US
      Node.JS Development Kickstarter Appliance</a> which uses a fixed range of local IP addresses.
      If you're doing the same, you can click on either of the two links to see this page served via
      HTTP or HTTPS. 
    </p>
   
    <ul>
      <li>HTTP: <a href="http://helium.l.nodify.us:10101/">http://helium.l.nodify.us:10101/</a></li>
      <li>HTTPS: <a href="https://helium.l.nodify.us:10102/">http://helium.l.nodify.us:10102/</a></li>
    </ul>
   
    <p>
      If you're running this example on a different host, you'll likely have to modify the URLs in the links
      above.
    </p>
   
    <p>
      Also, if you click on the HTTPS link above, your browser should give you a dire warning that you're
      about to click on a site whose URL doesn't match the name in the certificate. This is because the
      certificate we distribute with this package is completely insecure. Please don't try to use it on
      a production system (or any system with sensitve data.)
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The easiest way to create your own key and certificate is to use the <a href="http://www.openssl.org/">OpenSSL</a> command line utility
      to generate the appropriate key and CSR (Certificate Signature Request) files. You then pick a
      Certifying Authority to sign the public key associated with the private key you generated and
      follow their process to retrieve a server certificate.
